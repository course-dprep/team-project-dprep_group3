# Data Preparation Team Project on Director's Impact on Movie Ratings

## Introduction
Are directors listed in the top 100 more likely to receive higher average ratings compared to those who are not listed, and is there a correlation between the average ratings of movies directed by a director and the average number of votes those movies receive?

This research investigates the impact of a director's renown on movie ratings and audience engagement. We explore whether high-profile directors consistently produce higher-rated movies and examine how these ratings correlate with viewer votes. Additionally, we consider how various factors might influence the relationship between a director's reputation and their movie's success. Our goal is to shed light on the dynamics at play between directorial fame, movie ratings, and audience participation, providing insights into the broader implications for the film industry.

## Motivation
The oscars are always overloaded with rumours about which famous director will win the prices that year. However, does a good director always result in a high rating of a movie? Is this rating biased on the director, or does a good director also receives low ratings for some of his movies? For this questions, the IMDb ratings data set can provide valuable insides. This data will be combined with the director of the movies to observe if any trends/effects can be find. This could provide valuable insides in the film industry and for large film houses. After analysing these trends/effects it will be analyzed why these treds/effects take place.

## Method and results

### Methods
Our approach involves detailed data preparation, including downloading, cleaning, merging, and analyzing data to examine the correlation between directors and movie ratings. We utilize R for statistical modeling, employing linear regression, ANOVA, and logistic regression analyses to dissect the influence of directors, considering variables such as movie genres and audience reception.

## Running instructions

To conduct our analysis, ensure R is installed along with tidyverse package, which includes 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'readr', and 'stringr' libararies. Start by executing src/data-preparation/download_data.R for data download. Follow the Makefile in src to sequentially process data preparation, analysis, and paper compilation steps. 

For detailed environment setup instructions, refer to [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/):  


    - R Setup: Visit [https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/computer-setup/software-installation/rstudio/r/]at Tilburg Science Hub for a comprehensive guide.  


    - Make Setup: Check out ["Set up Make"](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automation/automation-tools/makefiles/make/) to streamline workflows.

Running The Code By Make
To execute the analysis, please follow these instructions:

1. Fork and Clone the Repository:  

Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
Open your command line/terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using:  

    `git clone https://github.com/course-dprep/team-project-dprep_group3`  


2. Set Your Working Directory:  

Change your working directory to the cloned repository:  

    `cd team-project-dprep_group3`  


3. Run the Makefile:  

Execute the following command in your terminal:  


    `make`    


This command will start the data preparation, analysis, and compilation steps defined in the Makefile. It will generate analysis outputs, including cleaned datasets, statistical models, and visualizations.

4. View the Analysis Output:  

Upon successful completion, check the specified output directories for graphs, summary statistics, and other analytical insights generated by the code.

5. Clean Up:
To remove all raw and intermediate data files created during the analysis, ensuring that only the final outputs and source code remain, run:  


    `make clean`
